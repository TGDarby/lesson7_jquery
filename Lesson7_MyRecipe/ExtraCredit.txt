In this application, a height animation toggles on and 
off whenever a user hovers over a sub heading. This requires 
the DOM to be traversed so that the the event that happens on
an <h3> tag results in an animation of the contents of the 
<div> tag. This event also results in the background-color of 
the <h3> tag turning into the same blue as the header, giving 
the application some visual consistency. 

Further functionality was added through the creation of an 
event that turns individual <li> tags and <p> tags red when 
clicked. This would allow the user to keep track of what step
they are on and what ingredients have already been used.
